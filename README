AUV tools by Ian Katz (ijk5@mit.edu)

A php library for supporting my AUV web interface projects:
 * https://github.com/ifreecarve/MOOS-web-gui
 * https://github.com/ifreecarve/AUV-PlanIt

This code is currently lacking excessive comments, and the KML generation needs to be
revamped.

Built and tested on Ubuntu Linux; all documentation will assume that OS.

In order to install: 
 0. you will need to apt-get install the following (and maybe more):
      php-mdb2-driver-mysql (pulls in php-pear, php-mdb2, and php5-mysql)
      apache2
 1. modify your php include path (in php.ini) to includes this php directory
    include_path = ".:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear:/PATH/TO/AUV-phplib"
